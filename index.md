## Bio
Hello! I am Aayush (pronounced Eye-yoosh). My discord tag right now is Da Emporor#2496 (this changes a lot, so I just change my nickname on servers before I join). This will basically be my first course about software engineering specifically, but I've done a lot of random stuff in different fields like Game AI, Machine Learning, and Exploitation. I added OSS a bit late, but I'm going to catch up!
