# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

Essentially, Open Source is not just "here's the source code," but rather it is a structure that allows
developers to sort of bounce off of each other and increase compatibility.

Two additional suggestions for "How to answer questions in a helpful way" are:
* If you don't know, try to point them in the right direction.
* Try to get another person to verify the answer you give.

The 3rd chapter of Free Culture was very concerning to me. I found it ridiculous that the RIAA could even make a claim like that in the first place without being laughed off by the courts, but since it held up, it unsurprisingly came down to "you may be able to win this case, but at what cost?" The tactics used by the RIAA in this case remind me of SLAPP lawsuits, which abused the expensiveness of legal cases to shut down opposition from individuals. However, until the copyright system gets suitably revised, this chapter reminded me to be careful when handling large amounts of data coming from multiple sources and to be careful when creating open source software, as you never know what exactly could cause a company to try to turn you into a scapegoat (if you do, you either are or should be a lawyer).
