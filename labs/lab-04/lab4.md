## 2. Reading
The writer of the article has a bit of a strong opinion, saying that any software that does not fulfill the 4 criteria of free software (freedom to run, freedom to study/modify, freedom to redistribute, freedom to distribute modified copies) is unethical. They do make a distinction between free and commercial software, though.

## 3. Important to Choose a License
It is important to choose a license because it helps the distributor to determine how they want their software to be used by others.
Additionally, a license helps protect the creator of the software and/or holds them accountable should any issues arise from the work.

## 4. Important to NOT Use Unlicensed Software
If software does not have an explicit license, the user of said software could be subject to a whole slew of legal issues, as it is generally a muddy area of the law.
Also, unlicensed software generally does not receive support from its creators and could be a security risk.
