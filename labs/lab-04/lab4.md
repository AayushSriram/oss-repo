# Lab 4 - Licensing

## 2. Reading
The writer of the article has a bit of a strong opinion, saying that any software that does not fulfill the 4 criteria of free software (freedom to run, freedom to study/modify, freedom to redistribute, freedom to distribute modified copies) is unethical. They do make a distinction between free and commercial software, though.

## 3. Important to Choose a License
It is important to choose a license because it helps the distributor to determine how they want their software to be used by others.
Additionally, a license helps protect the creator of the software and/or holds them accountable should any issues arise from the work.

## 4. Important to NOT Use Unlicensed Software
If software does not have an explicit license, the user of said software could be subject to a whole slew of legal issues, as it is generally a muddy area of the law.
Also, unlicensed software generally does not receive support from its creators and could be a security risk.

## 5. Why the Web Beat Gopher
I agree that failing to follow an open source model was a major factor in killing Gopher. For a project as big as the Web, every extra mind counts that much more, even if you would ordinarily think that it would be too cluttered. Since the Web had a large amount of contributors, the main development team did not have nearly as much pressure on them to come up with ideas and fixes, unlike Gopher's dev team.

## 6. .NET using MIT License
.NET uses an MIT License to help foster support from the greater community. Since the MIT License allows "the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,"<sub>[source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)</sub> Microsoft is essentially allowing anybody to work on \(and make contributions to\) .NET without any major restrictions. Since .NET core is widely used and has many different applications \(such as machine learning, cross-platform development, and support for multiple programming languages <sub>[source](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/dotnet-core)</sub>\), having many contributors can help lower the workload for the official development team and ensures that the software is constantly receiving updates for continued use.
